2017-04-09: Anvio Mapping update
	anvio_mapping failed becasue instead of linking the perl script to the mapping.sh in the BAMtools folder,
	I coppied mapping.sh to my present working directory. This prevented the script from finding the other files
	in the folder that were needed to complete the command.

	Note: updated mapping.pbs cript updated. Open script and follow the included instructions 

2017-04-06: Anvio Mapping Update
	In order to take use the differential coverage binning within CONCOCT (via Anvi'o), you need to run the anvio mapping module for each sample SEPARATELY. This requires 
	making BAM files. 

	BAM files- files were made from raw fwd and rev read files (NOT QC'ed, will cause problems, trust Sharon.)

	Steps to use mapping:
		1. Make directory for each read file containing BAM files and scaffold file (Assembly output).
			Note: As these files already exist in your directory, you can make symbolic links. (ln -s [file linl] [link name]
		2. Make a pbs filing for each sample directory
		3. Run anvi_mapping_Sample337##.pbs

		Note: An example mapping pbs is included in GIT repos


2017-04-02: Resolved calling the perl scripts but am not sure what files we need and how to get them to run the mapping script:
From mapping.sh:
	path2scaffolds=$1/scaffold.fasta <-- is the the same as the contig file?
	path2fwd=$1/fwd.fastq <-- are these fastq files generated from the reads or the assembly?
	path2rev=$1/rev.fastq
	path2scripts="/geomicro/data1/COMMON/scripts/BamTools"
	threads=14


Notes:
1. The following command does not work in this order:
module load python-anaconda2/latest gsl ncbi-blast prodigal/2.6.2 hmmer mcl centrifuge diamond anvio
instead: module load gsl ncbi-blast prodigal/2.6.2 hmmer mcl centrifuge diamond anvio python-anaconda2/latest

2. Must reformat contig file to avoid sassy message from Anivo. 
Run script: anvi-script-reformat-fasta [whatever contig file name].fa -o contigs-fixed.fa -l 0 --simplify-names
Now make sure the anvio_gen_contigs.pbs calls the new, fixed file.
